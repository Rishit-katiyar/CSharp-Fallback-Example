# Resilient Application Development with C# Fallback Mechanisms ðŸš€

Welcome to the Resilient Application Development repository! This project provides examples and implementations of fallback mechanisms in C# to enhance the resilience and reliability of your applications. Whether you're dealing with network requests, file processing, database access, or service integrations, these fallback mechanisms ensure graceful degradation and robust error handling.

## Introduction

In today's dynamic and interconnected software landscape, application resilience is crucial. Fallback mechanisms act as safety nets, enabling your applications to gracefully handle errors and failures, thus providing a better user experience and reducing downtime.

This repository contains C# examples demonstrating fallback mechanisms for various scenarios, including network requests, file processing, database access, and service health checks.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 5.0 or higher)

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/CSharp-Fallback-Example.git
```

### Building and Running

Navigate to the project directory and build the solution using the following commands:

```bash
cd ResilientApplication
dotnet build
```

To run a specific example, navigate to its directory and execute the corresponding C# file:

```bash
cd NetworkRequestFallback
dotnet run
```

## Usage

### Network Request Fallback

The `NetworkRequestFallback.cs` example demonstrates a fallback mechanism for network requests. It attempts to make a request to a primary endpoint and falls back to a secondary endpoint if the primary one is unavailable.

### File Processing Fallback

The `FileProcessingFallback.cs` example illustrates a fallback mechanism for file processing. It attempts to read data from a primary file and falls back to reading data from a fallback file if the primary one is not found.

### Database Access Fallback

The `DatabaseAccessFallback.cs` example showcases a fallback mechanism for database access. It attempts to connect to a primary database and falls back to connecting to a fallback database if the primary one is inaccessible.

### Service Health Check

The `ServiceHealthCheck.cs` example demonstrates a service health check mechanism with a fallback. It checks the health of a primary service URL and falls back to a secondary service URL if the primary one is down.
